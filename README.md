# Talos Homebrew Tap

- üî• Easy installation of [talosctl](https://github.com/siderolabs/talos), the reference CLI to use Talos OS
- ‚≠ê Works on macOS (Intel/ARM) and Linux (amd64/arm64/armv7)
## How do I install talosctl?

Installing talosctl is simple:
```
brew install siderolabs/talos/talosctl
```

You can also only add the tap which makes formulae within it available in search results (`brew search` output):

```
brew tap siderolabs/talos
brew install talosctl
```

Note: since the `v1.4.4` release the `talosctl` Cask is deprecated in favor of a more universal `talosctl` formula. If you have the Cask installed, you need to uninstall it first: `brew uninstall --cask talosctl`.
